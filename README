I. Adding the ese layer to your build
=================================================

cd ~ && mkdir yocto && cd yocto 
git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky.git
cd ~/yocto/poky
git clone git@github.com:Deadolus/meta-ese.git
cd ~/yocto
source poky/oe-init-build-env

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the ese layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the ese layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-ese \
    "

This is typically in ~/yocto/build/conf/bblayers.conf

II. Building the ese-image
========

To build the meta-ese example image "ese-image" (assuming I: has been done):

cd ~/yocto/
source poky/oe-init-build-env
bitbake ese-image

The finished image can then be found under

~/yocto/build/tmp/deploy/qemux86/


III. Misc
========

This is a demo layer accompanying the talk of Simon Egli at the ESE-Kongress 2015.
It ads a recipe and patches another recipe.
Working as of December 2015, but don't expect anything useful for production from this demo layer.
